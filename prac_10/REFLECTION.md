# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

My estimated time is usually longer than the actual time I spend. 
That is to say, I usually write faster than I expected.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

I continuously optimized the prediction time by referring to the previous completion times, 
and improving my proficiency, making it closer to the actual time.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I have learned to manage my time when writing code,
and constantly shorten the time it takes to complete the code.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

I have noticed that sometimes I make some basic and minor mistakes,
and I fail to spot them when I review my own code. 
Having my code reviewed by others helps me identify,
and correct some errors that I might not have detected myself.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

I have learned to check my code multiple times after writing it. 
By identifying errors in others' code, it also helps me correct the errors in my own code,
and prevent some errors from occurring.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

### Explanation

Overall, this student's code does not have any serious problems. 
I pointed out many details of error for him. 
These minor issues might not have been detected by him during his own inspection. 
For example, self.fanciness should be equal to fanciness rather than 0.0. 
He made some typing errors. Moreover, he made some mistakes in reading the questions, 
such as not paying attention to the sample output,
and not using the assert statement as required in the question to conduct tests.

### Good Code Review 2

### Explanation

Overall, this student's code does not have any serious problems. But there are some minor issues.
For instance, the magic number was not set as a constant, and "Hello" was mistakenly spelled as "Holle".

## Practicals


### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?
Overall, I think this course is well-designed. The teacher is very responsible. 
The PPT covers all the key points. The homework assignment is well designed.
I think I will make some minor adjustments to the "pull request" section. 
Because sometimes the students listed on the "mention" list are invited to write reviews, 
but they don't respond. I need to find some classmates I know to write the review for me.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I carefully read the questions, thought carefully, and completed the homework requirements. 
I constantly adjusted the code based on the sample output to make it conform to the sample output.
I carefully review each line of code, assessing whether it adheres to the SRP principle and whether the names are appropriate.
