## Clean Code Lessons Learned
Below are the main lessons learned about writing clean code throughout this subject:
- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** Ensure that every function and class has only one task, keeping the code modular.
- **Avoid Magic Values:** Use named constants (CONSTANTS) to replace numbers or strings hardcoded directly into the code (Magic Numbers/Values).
- **Descriptive Naming:** Use meaningful variable and function names to improve code readability.
- **Docstrings:** Write clear documentation strings for all functions, classes and methods in the codes.
