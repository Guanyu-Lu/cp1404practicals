# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?
I have learned to make the naming process as meaningful as possible.
I have learned to simplify the code as much as possible to avoid repetition, in order to reduce the burden on the computer.
I have learned how to commit and push the code.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?
Try to make the names of variables/constants meaningful as much as possible.
Try to improve the quality of the code during the first attempt, rather than discovering problems and modifying the code later during the review process.
Pay more attention to the details of the code.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?
After each completion, commit and push immediately.
Repeatedly checking the code revealed and corrected the problems

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?
Sometimes the code is not concise enough, and the naming of variables is not meaningful enough.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

I think it's already quite good, so I have no suggestions.
